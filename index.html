	<h3>History of t160k</h3>
	<p>The t160k initiative was started in 2012 to save over 160,000 manuscripts from Timbuktu, Mali that were under threat of destruction from the unstable political situation in the north of the country.</p> 
	<p>Under threat from fundamentalist rebels, a team of archivists, librarians, and couriers evacuated an irreplaceable trove of manuscripts from Timbuktu, Mali at great personal risk. The manuscripts have been saved from immediate destruction, but the danger is not over. A massive archival effort is underway to protect this immense global heritage from loss, and more is still needed.</p>
	<h3>2013 Indiegogo campaign</h3>
	<p>The indiegogo campaign "Libraries in Exile" was sponsored by T160K, an international initiative forged in the evacuation of these treasures from Timbuktu and dedicated to protecting and preserving them until they can be returned to their home. It is the center of a growing global family who have pledged to this urgent effort.</p>
	<p>Funds contributed to this project were used to purchase moisture traps, archival boxes, and the additional footlockers required to safely store these manuscripts, as well as to cover the significant labor effort required to unbox and re-pack the manuscripts for preservation.</p>
	<h3>Future of t160k</h3>
	<p>New things are in store for the future of t160k. Keep up with us on facebook or twitter to find out what is in store!</p>
